Also there are images of data and dashboards for each shop 

## ðŸ”¥ Key Insights:
- All locations show a strong positive growth trend, suggesting increasing customer demand over time.  
- Weekdays are consistently busy across all locations, especially in the morning hours between 7am and 10am,
indicating a likely demand for breakfast items, coffee, and quick service.
- However, the evening hours after 6 pm in Lower Manhattan and after 7 pm in Hell's Kithcen show very low transactions.   
- Coffee is the primary driver of sales across all locations, with tea and bakery items contributing to a smaller extent.

## ðŸ’¡ What recomendations can be offered:
- Since the evening hours are not busy, the store can loose money by keeping the store open after 6pm and it worth to change store's operations hours.  
- Offering discounts and promotions to customers in slow hours could encourage more people to visit when the store isnâ€™t already overwhelmed.   
- Promoting items like breakfast sandwiches or pastries alongside coffee during peak hours could increase the average transaction value.
